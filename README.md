# Sign_LANGUAGE_DETECTION-using-CNN-and-ViT
This project implements a Sign Language Detection System using Deep Learning techniques to recognize hand gestures representing digits (0–9) and alphabets (a-z). The system is designed to assist communication for speech and hearing-impaired individuals by identifying hand signs, using a live webcam, enabling interactive gesture recognition.
